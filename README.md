# Quizify: Quiz Project
## Description 

Quizzes have become a game of the past, as the world moves through the revolutionary phase of gaming and technology. However, the quiz project was designed and implemented in a way to rejuvenate an individual’s sense of rationale thought process by challenging their knowledge about topics they may have studied or have an interest in. 

Quizify, enables the user to participate in a challenging and fun process of quizzing where they are timed and scored based on correct and incorrect answers. 

This project enabled myself to understand how Web API’s and third-party API’s work and how I can utilize them in a project like this which can also help me further my understanding in these two topics.

## Project

Following deliverables were the benchmark for the project to be executed upon, 

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following is a live-demo of how the quiz works and what Quizify consists of.
